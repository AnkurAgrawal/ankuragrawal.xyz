    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">What is Orchestable?</h1>
    <p>Orchestable is a system which provides a digital multi-touch interface to a group of people for playing multiple musical instruments
    simultaneously on the same multi-touch screen. The user can play more than one musical instrument simultaneously with a more realistic
    user interface, broader accessibility and flexibility than those already existing. There are 4 different instruments available to choose
    from: Piano, Octapad, Congos and Drums.</p>

    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">Final Setup</h1>
    <p>The hardware of the project was implemented using a simple IR Camera, Plain Glass sheet, Wooden Table and a Short-throw Projector.
    Later, I had interfaced this project with the project of one of my colleague who had developed a sound processing module using MAX/MSP.</p>

    <p>One day, I was using a music application GarageBand on iPad and I thought why we can only play one instrument, why not multiple
    instruments simultaneously?</p>
    <p>After doing some <a href=\"#secondary_research\"><strong>Secondary Research</strong></a>, I found that people
    are trying to play multiple instrument in groups using this application but using multiple devices. I further searched for a good
    enough multi-touch application which allow users to play simultaneously on the same device but found nothing. So, I decided to create
    one myself. Orchestable is a touch device using which a group of people can play different (or same) music instruments simultaneously
    on the same device. The cost for the entire setup was $550 not including a computer for running the software on.</p>

    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">The Process</h1>
    <h2 id=\"secondary_research\">Secondary Research</h2>
    <p>After doing some research online, I came up with few design constraints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The touch screen should be big enough for a group of people to interact simultaneously.</li>
      <li>It has to be a low cost device to make it affordable.</li>
      <li>User should be able to dismantle the setup in order to move it around.</li>
      <li>The process of assembling the setup should be fairly easy to make it less time consuming.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since, a big capacitive touch screens was too costly, I began to research low cost methods of making a touch
    screen myself. I found few methods to build infrared based touch screens.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the cheapest hardware solutions among all six of them</li>
      <li>also reasonably accurate compared to technology like LED Light Plane</li>
      <li>the most accurate and effective is Frustated Internal Reflection but it is also the costliest one</li>

    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">What is Toothgloss?</h1>
    <p>ToothGloss is an advanced interdental cleaning system, to be used as a replacement, or supplement
      to traditional flossing. ToothGloss includes advanced technology gum-like Gloss sticks within a
      SmartBox, whose interactive digital screen empowers the users to set goals and schedules that work
      for their lives.</p>
    <p>The goal of this product is to make the activity of interdental cleaning fit better within people’s
      lives, allowing them to use the product regularly to improve their dental health.</p>
    <!--<h1 class=\"color-orange\">Why use Toothgloss?</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">How Toothgloss works?</h1>
    <p></p>-->
    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">How we started..</h1>
    <p>We started with forming a problem statement.</p>
    <p>The modern day medical system has learned what it takes to maintain healthy teeth throughout one’s
      lifetime, and created technology to enable users to act towards this endeavor. Yet, the rate of
      preventable oral disease remains high, even among highly educated populations with access to medical
      tools and expertise. What can be done to decrease these disease rates?</p>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange display-inline\">Identifying the problem.. </h1><h1 class=\"color-violet display-inline bold\">USER RESEARCH</h1>
    <p>With the problem statement in mind we decided to conduct over user research</p>
    <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Questionnaire</h2>
    <p>Armed with a narrowed focus on interdental cleaning, it was time to consult the users about their
      practices at home, so we created a Questionnaire using SurveyGizmo</p>
    <h2>Semi-Structured Interviews</h2>
    <p>These were performed by giving the interviewee the Questionnaire
      to understand where they fall in line with our survey participants, and then asking more specific
      questions about their feelings towards and motivations regarding their dental hygiene practices.
      These conversations were open-ended and only prompted when needed, allowing the user to
      provide the most unbiased information.</p>
    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>Our research methods showed that the design requirements are as follows. The design should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>be portable</li>
      <li>be quick to use and/or hands-free to allow multitasking</li>
      <li>show before and after results or provide other immediate feedback</li>
      <li>inform the user of health risks</li>
      <li>remind the user to perform interdental cleaning</li>
      <li>have neutral taste and be pain free</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">Our Design Question</h1>
    <p><blockquote>How can we improve the frequency and quality of user-performed interdental cleaning among
      working-age adults?</blockquote></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frequency and quality – many people do currently perform interdental cleaning, however irregularly, and often poorly.</li>
      <li>User-performed – research indicated the state of daily care of the teeth had more long term effect on oral health than the care that occurs at biannual visits to dental health professionals.</li>
      <li>Working-age – for the purposes of this study, this was defined as ages 16 through 60, encompassing the time when the mouth has fully matured up to the health changes of later life.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange display-inline\">The next step.. </h1><h1 class=\"color-violet display-inline bold\">IDEATION</h1>
    <div></div>
    <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/ideation_1.jpg\">

    <h2>Suction Wand</h2>
    <div class=\"one-third\">
      <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/suctionwand_1.jpg\">
        <img class=\"image-frame\" src=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/suctionwand_1.jpg\" height=\"170px\" />
      </a>
      <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/suctionwand_2.jpg\">
        <img class=\"image-frame\" src=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/suctionwand_2.jpg\" height=\"170px\" />
      </a>
    </div>
    <p>The SuctionWand is perhaps the most familiar dental product as a comparable suction
      device is currently used in dental offices and it looks similar to an electric toothbrush or
      Waterpik®. The user manually moves the wand around their mouth while it provides suction to
      remove the plaque around and in between the teeth. The SuctionWand can also deliver ultrasonic
      pulses to loosen plaque that may be too dried on for the vacuum to remove. The suction feature
      is messfree since no postcleaning spitting is required, allowing it to be used anywhere. The
      device only uses suction where plaque is detected, speeding up the process. When plaque is
      found, the device will beep at the user as a warning and then automatically begin suction,
      providing immediate feedback that plaque has been removed.</p>
      <p>These results are recorded and uploaded to an app where the user can also set goals and
      get reminders via text message. The app shows the potential oral health risks of not using the
      SuctionWand, and as additional motivation to utilize the device regularly, the users’ results are
      uploaded to their dentists’ leaderboard where they can compete with other patients. For users
      who are not smartphone enabled, a simple alarm reminder can be set on the device using small
      dials. The SuctionWand is a onehanded device allowing for a semimultitasking experience, but
      it is fast and painfree (except maybe for a few users with very sensitive teeth), with the added
      socialmedia motivational component. The product is also reusable, making it more expensive up
      front, but longerlasting and less wasteful. It is also very small and light for portability. The
      wand’s vacuum core will need to be emptied infrequently, and the device notifies the user via a
      series of beeps when this needs to be performed.</p>
    <h2 class=\"clear-both\">ToothGloss</h2>
    <div class=\"one-third\">
      <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/toothgloss_1.jpg\"><img class=\"image-frame\" src=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/toothgloss_1.jpg\" height=\"170px\" /></a>
      <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/toothgloss_2.jpg\"><img class=\"image-frame\" src=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/toothgloss_2.jpg\" height=\"170px\" /></a>
    </div>
    <p>ToothGloss is gum that flosses. Less viscous and more sticky than typical chewing gum,
      it flows between and around the teeth, grabbing the plaque. Upon spitting out the gum, the user
      can see the removed items stuck in the substance, giving immediate results. ToothGloss meets
      our design requirements of being portable and handsfree. It is cheap and disposable and also
      comes in different flavors. Its case has a slot for each day of the month, visually reminding the
      consumer to use the product. The reusable case provides a touchscreen interface where the user
      can set reminders and goals of what they would like accomplish by their next dental visit. The
      case also displays the risks that are avoided by using ToothGloss. This highertech
      case would be an investment upon beginning the using of the Glossing system, but is only purchased
      once. While gum is a familiar object, it is not made for every type of user. Those with
      temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), cannot chew gum frequently.</p>
    <h2 class=\"clear-both\">FlossBots</h2>
    <div class=\"one-third\">
      <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/flossbots_1.jpg\"><img class=\"image-frame\" src=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/flossbots_1.jpg\" height=\"170px\" /></a>
      <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/flossbots_2.jpg\"><img class=\"image-frame\" src=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/flossbots_2.jpg\" height=\"170px\" /></a>
      <a class=\"fancybox\" href=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/flossbots_3.jpg\"><img class=\"image-frame\" src=\"'.IMG_PATH.'/projects/toothgloss/flossbots_3.jpg\" height=\"170px\" /></a>
    </div>
    <p>FlossBots are microscopic robots contained within a userfriendly liquid medium. Using mass
      spectrometertype technology, they seek out the plaque in between and around the users’
      teeth, and then target those locations for scrubbingstyle cleaning. Nanobots are a budding
      technology currently being researched and developed as a less invasive way to pinpoint problems
      in human health. Delivery as a liquid enables the user flexibility of where to use the product; in
      their home or on the go. Interdental cleaning is made simple, efficient, and portable, and can
      come in different flavors for a variety of palates. Unlike floss, FlossBots is painfree
      and handsfree, allowing the user to multitask. Results are confirmed when the user spits out the
      cleaner; removed plaque can be viewed as a different color in the liquid. If spit out, the nanobots
      are removed; if the user is not in a situation where this is possible, such as the car, they are safe
      to swallow, seamlessly exiting the body with other nondigestibles.</p>
    <div class=\"clear-both\"></div>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange display-inline\">Molding our ideas.. </h1><h1 class=\"color-violet display-inline bold\">PROTOTYPING</h1>
    <p>We chose to do a prototype of the ToothGloss by creating a low-tech box
      (cardboard, hot glue, and springs) with a digital interface (JustInMind on cell phone). This
      allowed us to prototype five out of six of our design criteria, represented in bold below. In the
      short time flow of this project we were unable to obtain color changing gum to simulate plaque
      detection, however we were able to create a small and light portable box containing pain-free,
      taste optional (mint in this case), hands-free gum. The box’s screen interface allows the user to
      set goals and reminders and display informational health tips.</p>

      unfamiliar with flossing (cultural difference) and such we were solving a problem he did not
      have and gave him a little extra introduction to the situation. Two of the users were unaware that
      the alarm sound was in-fact meant for them, an apparent hazard of Wizard-of-Oz features in an
      uncontrolled environment. Minor tweaks were made to the interface between users, so they had
      slightly different experiences. Between the first and second tests we changed the screen
      resolution (switched phones) for a better user experience, and between the second and third tests
      we made some changes to the box labelling, adding a title and moving the day-by-day tickmarks
      per user suggestion.</p>
    <h2>Evaluation Tasks</h2>
    <p>Please read this paragraph out loud to become comfortable with narrating your thoughts for us:</p>
    <p>ToothGloss is an advanced flossing system. The futuristic gum can target and clean plaque
      between the teeth without the need for traditional flossing. This is an early prototype. Please
      complete the tasks below, talking aloud as you go. It is helpful to us if you narrate your thoughts,
      good, bad, weird etc during the evaluation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a goal to gloss weekdays at 7am.</li>
      <li>Add a reminder for 7am on weekdays.</li>
      <li>Add another goal to gloss on weekends.</li>
      <li>Set a reminder for Saturday at 3pm.</li>
      <li>Review the risks of not flossing.</li>
      <li>When your weekend alarm goes off, take out a piece of advanced technology gloss gum.</li>
      <li>Approximate which day’s gum you selected. Which day of which week was it?</li>
      <li>Find out more information about one of the risks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Post-Evaluation Questionnaire</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When performing the ToothGloss tasks, was anything confusing?</li>
      <li>When working with the interface, did ToothGloss do what you expected?</li>
      <li>What features did you like?</li>
      <li>What features need improvement or were missing?</li>
      <li>Would such a product motivate you to floss more?</li>
    </ul>",

    <p></p>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">Data Collection</h1>
    <p>To get the data related to Oscar movies that we needed, we used the official Academy Award database, as
      it is the most trusted source for Oscar related data. To collect other details of the movies in that
      list, we chose to use IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Both sources have an extension database and carry high
      credibility among the audience as information sources.</p>
    <p>To start, we downloaded the list of movies from the Academy Award database, and generated an ID number
    for every movie. This gave us a record for 8832 movies in the dataset. Using an ID for each would help to
      ease the merging process later on when we had additional data. Afterwards, we started collecting data
      from IMDb using a free web service API, OMDb. This API allows input for name and year of the movie, and
      provides additional details about that movie (if any record exists) in JSON format. Once we had the JSON
      data for all of the movies, we used a text editor (we chose Sublime Text) to reformat it. From here, we
      used OpenRefine to convert the data into tabular format, which is readable in Excel. This gave us the in-depth
      movie details data, which was then merged with the Oscar movie dataset using a custom Excel macro coded in
      Visual Basic. Later, we extracted Rotten Tomatoes’ data for their critics’ and users’ ratings. For this purpose,
      we used Rotten Tomatoes’ web API interface, and wrote a Python script to get the data in JSON format. We then
      merged it with the Oscar dataset following almost the same process as for the previous data merges.</p>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">With big data set came Big Problems!</h1>
    <p>Due to the inconsistent naming convention of IMDb, we had to manually search for approximately 1200 movies
      on the IMDb site in order to either correct the name or the movie release year, as many times Oscar nomination
      year and release year are different. Additionally, we used OpenRefine to correct any typos in the titles. Since
      many of our dimensions have multiple values, we were not able to use them for anything in Tableau other than as
      a filter using a calculated field and custom parameters. This created an issue for us in exploring our data. We
      addressed this by creating a natural join between the list of genre and the movie list, thus allowing us to use
      the genre field as a dimension that can be used in a graph. This would enable us to provide better data filtration
      methods for an end user.</p>
    <p>Though we eventually created a cohesive data set suitable for our purposes, we did experience some challenges.
      One of our biggest challenges in making meaning of this data was that the majority of the values were nominal data.
      This left us with few quantitative values that could be used for analysis. Fortunately, some of the nominal fields
      we had to work with make meaningful differences with regards to movie audiences, especially genre. One way we
      considered dealing with this challenge was to take the plot text data and classify each movie into a story type. The
      plan was to make this a filter in the data, so that users see comparisons between not only a movie’s genre, but a
      movie’s mood or plot as well. Ultimately, we discovered this to be a larger undertaking than would be worth
      undertaking, given the short time frame, and likely much more difficult than we would be prepared for as well.
      Previous research had been attempted using a machine learning algorithm and custom scripts to classify movies into
      strict genres using the plot synopsis found in IMDb. Unfortunately, this approach yielded results of only 12% accuracy
      (Tanenbaum, p6.) A possible reason for this is that most movies can accompany more than one genre type, which is also
      an issue we discovered within our dataset. For this reason, we decided to abandon this as a possible approach.</p>

    <p>Parking has always been a problem. It takes a lot of time to park a vehicle: navigating through the parking
      complex and finding an empty spot, then parking your vehicle and walk back to your destination. To solve
      this issue, we developed an automated parking system using which a user can leave his/her car at the entrance
      of the parking complex and the car will automatically park itself.</p>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">What does it do?</h1>
    <p>The car is equiped with an automated parking system which frees the user from all the problems related to
      parking. After the user leaves his car at the entrance, the car will autmatically traverse through the parking
      lot to find an empty space for parking. Upon finding an empty slot, it will park itself in the slot through
      an automated driving mechanism built inside the car.</p>
    <h1 class=\"color-orange\">How it works?</h1>
    <p>The system is equiped with an AT-Mega 8051 micro-controller and 3 IR sensors. Using these sensors the
    micro-controller checks for obtracles in the front, on the left and on the right.</p>

    "description": "
    <p>Voice interactive remote desktop software developed for TGMC (The Great Mind Challenge), a
    national level competition organized by IBM annually in India. Using Vocaloid a user can control its
    computer from anywhere over the network just by giving the voice commands, the computer will also respond
    to the users command through voice signals. The commands are fully configurable by the user. The user is
    first authenticated before remotely connecting to the computer. Encryption is also implemented for the
    data communication on the network. All these features makes the software highly secures. The software once
    completed will be uploaded on internet open source under GNU GPL License.</p>

    <h2 class="color-orange">How it works?</h2>
    <p>Linux is basicly a multiuser multi tasking operating system.It provides a basic required connectivity need
    between the hardware and the user.The voice commands which a user would give would be processed via Linux OS
    to make it match its library functions which would be authenticated through the database (DB2 in this case)
    as to what what a particular voice command maps to the system library function which is to be performed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user would give a command to the linux system through his voice ,interface to the user would be the
      Linux OS.</li>
      <li>Once the command gets transferred from the user and reaches the memory the role of voice recognition
      would come into play.The basic methodology which goes in voice recognition is that the system consists of
      an application that will be monitoring the audio input via a microphone and when a particular audio signal
      has been detected the, software would process and execute a desired set of results/actions which would be
      performed</li>
      <li>Linux has inbuilt support of many gstreamer and accessibility development libraries for our work.Thus
      our main focus would be to extract a particular voice command and convert that voice command to text.</li>
      <li>This text would then be mapped to the system library functions stored in the backend database and will
      be executed if they match.</li>
      <li>Thus it looks a simple process but involves a lot of work of core kernel and system libraries and in
      depth knowledge of linux and how it carries its interaction with the user.</li>

    Simulator is a research project of MNIT, Jaipur for developing a discrete event, cycle accurate simulator
    targeted at Network on Chip (NoC) research. The project is carried under the supervision of Prof. M.S. Gaur,
    Former HOD, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, MNIT, Jaipur.<br /><br />ACO routing is known
    to be capable of adapting to the necessary environmental conditions. These condition can be varied to get
    a optimized route in the current environmental conditions. The task assigned to me was to implement the ACO
    routing in NIRGAM simulator to find the optimum route with shorter route length and minimal power consumption
    over the network. The routing implemented was also able to adjust in order to minimize the congestion. The
    algorithm implemented was generic w.r.t. the topology of the network. The project was completed under the
    guidance of Prof. M.S. Gaur.",
