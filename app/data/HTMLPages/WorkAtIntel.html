  <div class="section-body">
    <p>For a better part of the last 3.5 years, I have been working on bringing a concept of smart space for children to life. Since I joined Intel Labs as a design technologist and started KidSpace, I have helped shape the future direction of the project by iteratively doing field research, creating concept designs, storyboarding, fabricating, developing the prototypes, and running usability tests of the concept prototypes.</p>
    <p>Currently, we are exploring how projection, sensing, sense-making, tangibles, materials, instrumentation, language interaction, game design and AI can come together to create a cohesive experience for orimary school children (age under 8 years old).</p>
    <p>I am leading the deveopment of the design and development of the contextual layer of the project. I collaborate with experts from diverse areas such as audio, visual, dialog, activity, and human behavior understanding. I am creating a scalable contextual aware experience, in Unity, which connects with all the input and output interactive modules to present a responsive physical environment.</p>

  <h6 class="section-heading">Responsive Materials</h6>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>On the side, I like to explore the possibilities of different materials for interface designs. Recently, I designed few heat sensitive actuators from a readily available composite of metal and plastic. These actuators can be used to design complex shape changing interfaces using folds such as in origami structures. The composition and layers of different materials on the actuator affect the curvature of the fold.</p>
    <p><strong>Sorry, but this as far as it goes over here. These are ongoing projects and much of them is still un-published or have patent pending!</strong></p>
