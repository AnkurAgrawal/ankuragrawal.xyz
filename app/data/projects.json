      "description": "<project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('picture-existing-candy-bowl.jpg')}}\" alt=\"Candy bowl\"></project-image-container> <p>Sweet Treat started with the idea of redesigning candy bowl to solve a problem department of HCDE was facing, which after our research we realised wasn't just HCDE's problem but almost everywhere. The problem was good candy running out too soon and less desirable candy not getting picked up by anyone. Over the course of next ten weeks, we set out to solve this issue of loneliness of less desirable candy.</p> <div class=\"design-process\"> </div> <p>We started with doing <b>field research</b> to find out the cause of the problems so we can design to solve them. Our research developed into <b>three clear findings</b>.</p> <div class=\"research-findings list\"> <span class=\"finding\">Free candy in the office provides a place for people to interact with others. However, some less positive social interactions happen when people sitting near the bowl are frequently interrupted by candy takers who feel the need to justify their actions.</span> <span class=\"finding\">The department thinks the bowl belongs to everyone in the office, with the burden of buying and refilling candy being shared by everyone in the office. But people only take candy from it, and complain to the office manager when the bowl is empty.</span> <span class=\"finding\">The bowl is usually filled with a variety of candy at first. But some types of candy run out more quickly than others because people tend to pick the same types of candy. This leaves the less desirable ones at the bottom of the bowl for a long time before they are finally selected.</span> </div> <p>We then translated these findings into <b>three design opportunities</b></p> <div class=\"design-opportunities list\"> <span class=\"design-opportunity\">Enrich positive social interactions among HCDE staff, faculty and students.</span> <span class=\"design-opportunity\">Encourage all staff in the office to refill the candy bowl, and foster the collective sense of responsibility.</span> <span class=\"design-opportunity\">Make the candy bowl consumption sustainable, in both speed of consumption and diversity of choice.</span> </div> <p>We used these findings to <b>brainstorm, ideate, sketch and design</b> an initial prototype. The efforts was focused on making the bowl easier to refill, increasing the variety of candy in the bowl at any given time, and increasing engagement in the office surrounding it</p> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Brainstorming</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ 'picture-prototype-1-brainstorming_1.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-brainstorming_2.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-brainstorming_3.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-brainstorming_4.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-brainstorming_5.jpg']\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image)}}\" alt=\"1st prototype brainstorming\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Making of prototype</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ {alt: 'Sketch of 1st prototype', name: 'sketch-prototype-1-making_1.jpg'}, {alt: '1st prototype in making', name: 'picture-prototype-1-making_1.jpg'}, {alt: '1st prototype in making', name: 'picture-prototype-1-making_2.jpg'}, {alt: '1st prototype in making', name: 'picture-prototype-1-making_3.jpg'}, {alt: '1st prototype in making', name: 'picture-prototype-1-making_4.jpg'}, {alt: '1st prototype', name: 'picture-prototype-1-making_5.jpg'} ]\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image.name)}}\" alt=\"{{image.alt}}\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Finished low fidelity prototype</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ 'picture-prototype-1-finished_1.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-finished_2.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-finished_3.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-finished_4.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-finished_5.jpg']\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image)}}\" alt=\"1st finished prototype\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Usability testing</h6> <p>We were then able to do some rapid testing on the prototype and get feedback about what wasn't clear. Our main goal was to gather feedback on the 3 digital challenges and the overall physical design. For testing, the prototype was <b>placed in a public place</b> in out department where students, staff, and faculty would pass by. Participants were those who walked and took a few minutes to explore the prototype. The researcher standing near the prototype conducted a brief interview asking them about their experience.</p> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ 'picture-prototype-1-testing_1.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-testing_2.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-testing_3.jpg', 'picture-prototype-1-testing_4.jpg']\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image)}}\" alt=\"1st prototype testing\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <p>Ultimately, we had 7 participants complete our study which uncovered several key usability issues.</p> <div class=\"usability-findings list\"> <span class=\"finding\">The purpose of the charity box and the sugar rush box is unclear.</span> <span class=\"finding\">The sliding game is too time consuming.</span> <span class=\"finding\">It is unclear the the drawer contains different candy.</span> <span class=\"finding\">The buttons are hard to select due to their size.</span> </div> <p>Time to brainstorm again. As a result of the findings from our testing, we made modifications to the design of both the physical and digital parts of the prototype.</p> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ 'picture-prototype-2-brainstorming_1.jpg', 'picture-prototype-2-brainstorming_2.jpg']\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image)}}\" alt=\"2nd prototype brainstorming\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <p>From there, <b>we created Sweet Treat</b>, a redesigned candy bowl that asks users to complete a challenge in order to earn their candy. Those that don't have time to play the challenge can simply grab a piece of less desirable candy from the tray at the top of the machine. Finally, the auto-refilling drum means that the candy bowl has to be filled less, while extending the variety of candy in the bowl.</p> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Making of final prototype</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ 'picture-prototype-2-making_1.jpg', 'picture-prototype-2-making_2.jpg', 'picture-prototype-2-making_3.jpg']\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image)}}\" alt=\"2nd prototype in making\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Finished final prototype</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ 'picture-prototype-2-finished_1.jpg', 'picture-prototype-2-finished_2.jpg', 'picture-prototype-2-finished_3.jpg', 'picture-prototype-2-finished_4.jpg', 'picture-prototype-2-finished_5.jpg']\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image)}}\" alt=\"2nd finished prototype\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Digital interaction design</h6> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('picture-prototype-2-finished-digital.jpg')}}\" alt=\"Digital interaction design\"></project-image-container> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Control system design</h6> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('picture-prototype-2-finished-electronic.jpg')}}\" alt=\"Electronic control system design\"></project-image-container>",

      "description": "<project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('hardware_1.jpg')}}\" alt=\"ToothGloss\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></project-image-container><p>The goal of this product is to make the activity of interdental cleaning fit better within people’s lives, allowing them to use the product regularly to improve their dental health. ToothGloss includes advanced technology gum-like Gloss sticks within a SmartBox, whose interactive digital screen empowers the users to set goals and schedules that work for their lives.</p><section> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Problem Statement</h6> <div class=\"section-body\"> <p>The modern day medical system has learned what it takes to maintain healthy teeth throughout one’s lifetime, and created technology to enable users to act towards this endeavor. Yet, the rate of preventable oral disease remains high, even among highly educated populations with access to medical tools and expertise. What can be done to decrease these disease rates?</p> <p>To ansnwer this question, we started out with conducting user research.</p> <p><strong>Secondary Research:</strong> We focused on working-age adults for the purposes of this study. This was defined as ages 16 through 60, encompassing the time when the mouth has fully matured up to the health changes of later life. We categorized our findings by Cause & Fix, to help identify which problems were best to investigate. We found that 40% of the working-age adults are facing dental health issues with gum desease and tooth decay being the most common of them. Best fixes for the health issue are preventative: Fluoridated water, Brush twice daily, and Floss daily. Among these flossing was least popular and performed less frequently. That became the focus of our project.</p> <p><strong>Questionnaire:</strong> Armed with a narrowed focus on interdental cleaning, it was time to consult the users about their practices at home, so we created a <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1863812/Interdental-Cleaning\">Questionnaire</a> using SurveyGizmo. Some survey findings:</p> <ul> <li>51% do not/believe they do not have time or think flossing takes too long</li> <li>46% don’t feel the need to floss because they brush well</li> <li>43% forget</li> <li>12% feel lazy</li> </ul> <p><strong>Semi-Structured Interviews:</strong> These were performed by asking interviewees questions about their dental hygiene practices and motivations behind them. These conversations were open-ended and only prompted when needed, allowing the user to provide the most unbiased information.</p> <ul> <li>Confirmed lack of flossing because people feel they do not have time.</li> <li>Revealed issues w/ taste, difficulty w/ mouth hardware, effects of conversations with dental hygienists</li> </ul> </div></section><section> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Design Question</h6> <div class=\"section-body\"> <p>From our findings, we derived the design question to guide us during the ideation phase.</p> <blockquote class=\"intro\">How can we improve the frequency and quality of user-performed interdental cleaning among working-age adults?</blockquote> <p>Our research showed that the design should:</p> <ul> <li>be portable</li> <li>be quick to use and/or hands-free to allow multitasking</li> <li>show before and after results or provide other immediate feedback</li> <li>inform the user of health risks</li> <li>remind the user to perform interdental cleaning</li> <li>have neutral taste and be pain free</li> </ul> </div></section><section> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Ideation</h6> <p>For ideation all of the group members brought sketches of their concepts and shared with the entire group. We disected each concepts to extract the underlying features and put them up on the board. Later we sorted the features by categories, then ranking them within each category. The features ranking higher in each category were pulled together and re-organized into artifact combinations & re-sketched for a list of potential final design concepts.</p> <div class=\"section-body\"> <p></p> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-12 large-12\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('ideation_1.jpg')}}\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"239\"></project-image-container> </div> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-4 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('ideation_2.jpg')}}\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" ></project-image-container> </div> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-4 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('ideation_3.jpg')}}\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" ></project-image-container> </div> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-4 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('ideation_4.jpg')}}\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" ></project-image-container> </div> </div> <p></p> <h6>Suction Wand</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('suctionwand_1.jpg')}}\" width=\"823\" height=\"1000\" ></project-image-container> </div> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('suctionwand_2.jpg')}}\" width=\"823\" height=\"1000\" ></project-image-container> </div> </div> <p>The SuctionWand is perhaps the most familiar dental product as a comparable suction device is currently used in dental offices and it looks similar to an electric toothbrush or Waterpik®. The user manually moves the wand around their mouth while it provides suction to remove the plaque around and in between the teeth. It uses an ultrasonic pulses to loosen plaque that may be too dried on for the vacuum to remove. Being a portable onehanded device it allows for a semimultitasking experience. The product is also reusable, making it more expensive up front, but longerlasting and less wasteful. The wand notifies the user via a series of beeps when this needs to be performed.</p> <h6>ToothGloss</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('toothgloss_1.jpg')}}\" width=\"649\" height=\"768\" ></project-image-container> </div> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('toothgloss_2.jpg')}}\" width=\"649\" height=\"768\" ></project-image-container> </div> </div> <p>ToothGloss is gum that flosses. Less viscous and more sticky than typical chewing gum, it flows between and around the teeth, grabbing the plaque. Upon spitting out the gum, the user can see the removed items stuck in the substance, giving immediate results. It is portable, handfree, cheap and disposable and also comes in different flavors. Its case has a slot for each day of the month, visually reminding the consumer to use the product. While gum is a familiar object, it is not made for every type of user. Those with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), cannot chew gum frequently.</p> <h6>FlossBots</h6> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('flossbots_1.jpg')}}\" width=\"629\" height=\"768px\"></project-image-container> </div> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('flossbots_2.jpg')}}\" width=\"629\" height=\"768px\"></project-image-container> </div> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl('flossbots_3.jpg')}}\" width=\"629\" height=\"768px\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> <p>FlossBots are microscopic robots contained within a userfriendly liquid medium. Using mass spectrometertype technology, they seek out the plaque in between and around the users’ teeth, and then target those locations for scrubbingstyle cleaning. Delivery as a liquid enables the user flexibility of where to use the product; in their home or on the go. Unlike floss, FlossBots is painfree and handsfree, allowing the user to multitask. Results are confirmed when the user spits out the cleaner; removed plaque can be viewed as a different color in the liquid.</p> </div></section><section> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Prototyping</h6> <div class=\"section-body\"> <p>Out of the three shortlisted design solutions we chose the ToothGloss as it allowed us to prototype five out of six of our design criteria. We created a low-tech box out of cardboard, and springs with a digital interface on the box using phone. The case has visual reminder slots for each day. In the short time flow of this project we were unable to obtain color changing gum to simulate plaque detection, however we were able to create a small and light portable box containing pain-free, taste optional (mint in this case), hands-free gum. The box’s screen interface allows the user to set goals and reminders and display informational health tips as seen in the snamshots below.</p> </div></section><section> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Physical Interface</h6> <div class=\"section-body\"> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ {'name':'hardware_2.jpg'}, {'name':'hardware_3.jpg'}, {'name':'hardware_4.jpg'}, {'name':'hardware_5.jpg'}, {'name':'hardware_1.jpg'}]\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image.name)}}\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> </div></section><section> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Digital Interface</h6> <div class=\"section-body\"> <div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x grid-margin-y image-grid-container\"> <div class=\"cell small-12 medium-6 large-4\" ng-repeat=\"image in [ {'name':'goal_1.jpg'}, {'name':'goal_2.jpg'}, {'name':'goal_3.jpg'}, {'name':'risk_1.jpg'}, {'name':'risk_2.jpg'}, {'name':'reminder_1.jpg'}, {'name':'reminder_2.jpg'}, {'name':'reminder_3.jpg'}, {'name':'reminder_4.jpg'}, {'name':'reminder_5.jpg'}, {'name':'reminder_6.jpg'}, {'name':'reminder_7.jpg'}]\"> <project-image-container src=\"{{getCurrentProjectImageAssetUrl(image.name)}}\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></project-image-container> </div> </div> </div></section><section> <h6 class=\"section-heading\">Usability testing</h6> <div class=\"section-body\"> <p>The evaluations were performed in the “wild” or uncontrolled environment of the school campus. After a brief introduction to the purpose of our system, the testers went through a series of tasks while thinking aloud.</p> <p>The users found a variety of places for improvement. Some particularly notable findings:</p> <ul> <li>one user was unfamiliar with flossing (cultural difference) and such we were solving a problem he did not have and gave him a little extra introduction to the situation.</li> <li>Two of the users were unaware that the alarm sound was in-fact meant for them, an apparent hazard of Wizard-of-Oz features in an uncontrolled environment.</li> <li>Minor tweaks were made to the interface between users, so they had slightly different experiences.</li> <li>Between the first and second tests we changed the screen resolution (switched phones) for a better user experience, and between the second and third tests we made some changes to the box labelling, adding a title and moving the day-by-day tickmarks per user suggestion.</li> </ul> <div class=\"callout\"> <h6>Evaluation Tasks</h6> <p>Please read this paragraph out loud to become comfortable with narrating your thoughts for us:</p> <p>ToothGloss is an advanced flossing system. The futuristic gum can target and clean plaque between the teeth without the need for traditional flossing. This is an early prototype. Please complete the tasks below, talking aloud as you go. It is helpful to us if you narrate your thoughts, good, bad, weird etc during the evaluation.</p> <ol> <li>Add a goal to gloss weekdays at 7am</li> <li>Add a reminder for 7am on weekdays</li> <li>Add another goal to gloss on weekends</li> <li>Set a reminder for Saturday at 3pm</li> <li>Review the risks of not flossing</li> <li>When your weekend alarm goes off, take out a piece of advanced technology gloss gum</li> <li>Approximate which day’s gum you selected. Which day of which week was it?</li> <li>Find out more information about one of the risks</li> </ol> <h6>Post-Evaluation Questionnaire</h6> <ol> <li>When performing the ToothGloss tasks, was anything confusing?</li> <li>When working with the interface, did ToothGloss do what you expected?</li> <li>What features did you like?</li> <li>What features need improvement or were missing?</li> <li>Would such a product motivate you to floss more?</li> </ol> </div> </div></section>",

Itinerant probes are not individualized, mediated artifacts, but instead dynamic events that en- liven people's personal and collective memories. Building on the probes literature and recent ecological perspectives, we describe three probes related to lighting that we investigated at three public sites. Our explorations with these probes highlight the intimate histories associated with public spaces.",
