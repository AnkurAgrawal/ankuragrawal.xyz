    <p>The project started with the idea of using visualization to predict patterns in movies that get nominated and ultimately win Oscar. During our research the goal of the projects pivoted to another tangent. The goal became, using visualization to see what makes a movie win Oscar among the nominees. This narrowed our scope to comparing winning movies with the nominated movies, as opposed to winning movies with all the movies.</p>

  <h6 class="section-heading">Data Collection</h6>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>To get the list of movies nominated for Oscars, we used the official <a class="link" href="http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/" target="_blank">Academy Award database</a> as our primary source. To collect the additional details we chose <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">IMDb</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> as our secondary sources.</p>
    <p>To start the collection process, we downloaded the list of movies from the Academy Award database. The list contained records of <strong>8832</strong> movies nominated so far for the Oscars. We generated an ID number for every movie to ease the merging process later on when we have additional data during post-processing. Afterwards, we started collecting data from IMDb using a free web service API, <a class="link" href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank">OMDb</a>. The API provides details in JSON format, which we re-formatted using a text editor, <a class="link" href="https://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>. From here, we used <a class="link" href="http://openrefine.org" target="_blank">OpenRefine</a> to convert the data into tabular format, which is readable in Excel. It was then merged with the Oscar movie dataset using a custom Excel macro coded in Visual Basic. Later, we extracted Rotten Tomatoes’ data for their critics’ and users’ ratings using Rotten Tomatoes’ web API interface. We wrote a Python script to get the data in JSON format and then merged it with the Oscar dataset following almost the same process as for the previous IMDB data merges.</p>

  <h6 class="section-heading">With big data set came Big Problems!</h6>
  <div class="section-body">
    <p>Due to the inconsistent naming convention of IMDb, we had to manually search for approximately 1200 movies on the IMDb site in order to either correct the name or the movie release year, as many times Oscar nomination year and release year are different. Additionally, we used OpenRefine to correct any typos in the titles. Since many of our dimensions have multiple values, we were not able to use them for anything in Tableau other than as a filter using a calculated field and custom parameters. This created an issue for us in exploring our data. We addressed this by creating a natural join between the list of genre and the movie list, thus allowing us to use the genre field as a dimension that can be used in a graph. This would enable us to provide better data filtration methods for an end user.</p>
    <p>Though we eventually created a cohesive data set suitable for our purposes, we did experience some challenges. One of our biggest challenges in making meaning of this data was that the majority of the values were nominal data. This left us with few quantitative values that could be used for analysis. Fortunately, some of the nominal fields we had to work with make meaningful differences with regards to movie audiences, especially genre. One way we considered dealing with this challenge was to take the plot text data and classify each movie into a story type. The plan was to make this a filter in the data, so that users see comparisons between not only a movie’s genre, but a movie’s mood or plot as well. Ultimately, we discovered this to be a larger undertaking than would be worth undertaking, given the short time frame, and likely much more difficult than we would be prepared for as well. Previous research had been attempted using a machine learning algorithm and custom scripts to classify movies into strict genres using the plot synopsis found in IMDb. Unfortunately, this approach yielded results of only 12% accuracy (Tanenbaum, p6.) A possible reason for this is that most movies can accompany more than one genre type, which is also an issue we discovered within our dataset. For this reason, we decided to abandon this as a possible approach.</p>
